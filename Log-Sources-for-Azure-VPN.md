# Jarvis and kusto queries

[[_TOC_]]

## Disclaimer

**_The following is an alternative if, for example, our primary tool ASC is having issues. ASC should always be your go to tool for troubleshooting VPN cases._**

## Jarvis 

All tables are going to be located in either :
- BRKGWT
- BRKGWM

## Kusto

Installing Kusto:

Replace cluster with aznw

![image.png](/.attachments/image-7f6b2158-53aa-4e47-a3e9-c915c47caa3a.png)

The majority of the tables will be located under aznwmds:

**NOTE**: Apart from using the VPN Dashboards, PG has stated that they are primarily using the following 3 tables. What is nice about these tables is that they have a column for "Message level". This column is useful for seeing if the message is informational / warning / or if there is a problem Error

## Tunnel insights events table
(only available for Route Based gateways)<br/><br/>
Useful for seeing why a s2s tunnel disconncted for example

## VPN Gateway Packets Insights Events table

```
## Ike logs table
(only available for Route Based gateways)<br/><br/>
Useful for seeing:
- inits sent or received
- rekeys
- retransmits
- reasons for why tunnel has gone down
- also useful for point to site clients using ikev2
- failover between instances due to planned upgrades / or quorum loss via message RPC call

Sample Jarvis query (in BRKGWT Namespace):

https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/4740506E

Sample Kusto Query

//Ikelogs
cluster("hybridnetworking").database("aznwmds").IkeLogsTable 
| where DeploymentId  contains "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
//| where PreciseTimeStamp >= datetime(2019-11-08 05:00) and TIMESTAMP  <= datetime(2019-11-08 23:00)

//| where RoleInstance == "GatewayTenantWorker_IN_0"
| project GatewayBuildVersion, TIMESTAMP, RoleInstance, EventMessage
```

## Ike Packet Logs table
(only available for Route Based gateways)<br/><br/>
Useful for seeing 
- IKE packets as well. 
- Can tell if Ikev1 or Ikev2 packets are sent. 
- DPD Packets

Jarvis Query (in BRKGWT Namespace): https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/31D0810A  
Add this string to the Client Query to make the table easier to read:  
```
select PreciseTimeStamp, EventMessage
```  
Kusto Query: This table does not exist in Kusto  

Example of DPD packets:  
- In the first packet (1), we see that the Azure GW receives an IKE packet from the remote site because it says `RECV Network Packet`. The remote site was the INITIATOR (we see it in the packet `0x8(INITIATOR, REQUEST)` so the remote end is sending the DPD packets to Azure first.  
- In the next packet (2), the Azure GW responds to the DPD packet, we know itâ€™s the response because it says `SEND Network Packet` and also the the `messid` is the same as the first packet so we know it is a response.  
- Packets 1 and 2 are a set of DPD packets. Packet 3 and 4 are a separate set of DPD packets.  
- Notice how there are 5 seconds between DPD packets by viewing the PreciseTimeStamp column. If there is no traffic passing over the tunnel, DPD packets will continue to be sent in 5 second intervals.  
- Also note that for packets 3 and 4, the `messid` is different than packets 1 and 2. This shows that these are two unique exchanges.

## Packet Insight Event Table  
(only available for Route Based gateways)<br/><br/>
PacketInsightEventTable shows when the VNG drops packets before forwarding them into a tunnel. For example, the VNG receives a packet from a VM in the VNet. It checks the destination IP and the configured Traffic Selectos for the active tunnels. If the destination IP of the VM's packet is not in any of the tunnels' traffic selectors, the VNG would drop the packet and not forward it into the tunnel to on-prem. These drops are logged in this table. Check this table if you suspect that the VNG is not forwarding packets to on-prem.  

[Jarvis Logs Link](https://jarvis-west.dc.ad.msft.net/45ED7A8D)  

Kusto Query:  
```Kusto
cluster('hybridnetworking').database('aznwmds').VpnGatewayPacketsInsightEventTable
| where GatewayId == "VNG GW ID goes here"
//| where Tenant == "VNG DepID/TenantID goes here - remove the comment marks // to use this filter"
| where TIMESTAMP > ago(1h)
//| where TIMESTAMP >= datetime(2019-02-27 17:15:00) and TIMESTAMP < datetime(2019-02-27 17:50:00)
```

## Tunnel Events table
(only available for Route Based gateways)<br/><br/>
Useful for seeing:
- Tunnel change state
- Was it a planned failover?
- Tunnel change reason ie DPD or peer sent a delete message
- how the tunnel was negotiated ie IKE and IPSEC parameters as well as what traffic selectors were used

Jarvis Query (in BRKGWT Namespace):

| project TIMESTAMP, RoleInstance, Message, DownTimeInMilliSeconds, IsPlannedFailover, TunnelName ,TunnelStateChangeReason, NegotiatedSAs

## Tenant Events Table
(only to be used for Policy Based gateways)<br/><br/>

## Point to Site logs table
(only available for Route Based gateways)<br/><br/>
